* #0 "0" "No aphasia; normal."
* #1 "1" "Mild-to-moderate aphasia; some obvious loss of fluency or facility of comprehension, without significant limitation on ideas expressed or form of expression.

For example, in conversation about provided materials, examiner can identify picture or naming card content from patient's response."

Range of information that can be exchanged is limited; listener carries burden of communication. Examiner cannot identify materials provided from patient response."
* #3 "3" "Mute, global aphasia; no usable speech or auditory comprehension."
